2023/11/15:
-Second  Version of Drone frame in Solidworks
-Stress Simulation for second drone frame using Solidworks Simulations
-ESPNow communication between 2 Wemos Lolin32 lite boards
-I2C library for MPU9250
-Programmed wireless PID value changer so that I can tune the PID controller without having to flash the program everytime I wanted to change values

2023/11/16:
-Discovered that glowforge mdk boards have a different thickness as stated on their website
-Updated the CAD with the new correct thickness
-Think Draft Board = 5.5mm
-Medium Draft Board = 3.3mm
-Tested for the optimal laser kerf using a custom test object I designed
-Optimal laser kerf for fitting medium draft board into thick draft board
-Optimal laser kerf = 0.16mm
-Exported CAD into .step file to open in fusion 360
-Used fusion 360's laser kerf add-in to transform all the faces into .dxf files for lasercutting
-Cut all drone frame pieces on the glowforge laser cutter (Took 6 hours)
-Needs 2 passes for both medium and thick draft boards
-For Think Draftboard: 2 pass 120 speed
-For Medium Draftboard: 2 pass 168 speed
-Remember to clean the camera regularly

2023/11//17:
-Took apart old drone frame
-Assembeled new drone frame
-Re-wired all electrical components (ESC to Wemos, Wemos Serial Communication to Arduino Uno, Arduino Uno to MPU9250 and FS 1A6B)
-Finished all ESC calibration
-Made sure every motor spins in the correct direction
-Repaired motor with bent main axle through hammering it

2023/11/18:
-Fixed all flight logic behind the flight controller
-Added the online PID tuner to the flight control main program
-Ran tests of the automatic PID tuner
-Attached Drone to testing rig
-Ran flight tests (2 hours of video footage, PID values used in Excel doc)
-Achived stationary hovering above the testing table for 5-6 sec
-Problems:
  -Drone drifts left, likely because I am using a angular velocity flight control and the table is slanted towards the left
  -Bolts become loose over time due to vibration
  -Collision with table side cracked the frame base board
-Solutions:
  -Use an angle based flight controller
  -Use lock nuts or put in spring washers
  -Better base plate design
-Plans for future: 
  -Direct I2C communication with Wemos board for faster update rate, currently at 125HZ, better to be 250HZ
  -Write library for intergrating anglular velocity values from MPU9250 to achive angle based flight controller
  -Order lock nuts

2023/11/21:

  -Intergration of angular velocity (Percise but Inaccurate)
  -Inverse trig of acceleration (not percise but accurate)
  -Merging of sensor values using a complementry filter


2023/11/24:
-Designed thrid itteration of drone frame
  -Weighs 1/3 of version 2
  -Left attachment slots for vector thrust control unit
  -Laser cut, pieced together with screw joints
  -Using nylon lock nuts for assembly to prevent loosening from vibration
-Ran stress simulations for third version of drone frame
  -Similar performance as second frane under same applied forces
  -Fixed points of concentrated stress

2023/11/25:
-Research on Pulse Position Modulation for reciving data from the IA6B radio reciever
-Programmed library for reading PPM signals for ESP32

2023/11/27:
-Manufractured part of frame V3 using the school Glowforge
  -Incorrect hole posistion for PCA9685
  -Incorrect hole size for battery mounting plate
-Took apart frame V2
-Assembled part of the frame V3

2023/11/28:
-Fixed all incorrect hole positionos
-Cut out all the modified parts
-Assembeled the frame

2023/11/29:
-Wired everything

2023/11/30:
-Lisa incident, all progress delayed

2023/12/1ï¼š
-Flight testing, 
-Pushed the throttle the wrong way
-Crashed the drone
-3 out of 4 arms completely broke off
-7 out of 8 propeller blades shattered 
-The propeller blades sliced through 3 of my ESC signal wires
-I want to die
